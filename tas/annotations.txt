Creepy similarities noticed:

- Toriel leaves Kris's bedroom moments before she appears for the first time in Undertale to rescue Frisk: 1:06

- The first time you see a froggit in both games syncs up, almost to the frame. The froggit appears in Deltarune at the same time that the Undertale fight is triggered and disappears in Deltarune just before the froggit appears in Undertale: 1:45

- Toriel holds Frisk's hand to lead the way across a field of spikes at the same time that Toriel holds Kris's hand to lead the way into school: 2:01

- Toriel disappears off the side of the screen at around the same time in both games: 2:19

- Toriel asks Frisk a question that doesn't matter at the same time that Susie asks Kris a question she doesn't care about the answer to: 3:07

- The Napstablook boss fight happens at the same time as the supply closet sequence. Both scenes have a character gain confidence at the same time, and both scenes have that character give up and go home at the same time: 3:54

- Loox (an eyeball) appears just as the floor of the supply closet disappears, leaving Kris and Susie in total darkness: 4:34

- Frisk reaches the room with a sign stating "the far door is not an exit. it merely marks a change in perspective." at the same time as Kris wakes up in the dark world: 4:53

- Both games have the first major bullet hell section start against the first royal character who is not named some arrangement of the letters "aeilrs" at the same time, and in both games, the attack passes the SOUL at the same time: 6:31

- Both bullet hell fights switch to a different attack pattern at the same time: 6:54

- Toriel tells Frisk "Go away!" at the exact same time that Ralsei tells Kris and Susie "Please come forward": 7:29

- Toriel turns to look at Frisk as Ralsei comes back onscreen and leaves just after Ralsei is revealed: 8:25

- The point of no return (represented by a door with the Delta Rune on it) happens at the same time in both games: 9:05

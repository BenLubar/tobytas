Game summary: Undertale

Undertale is a game about subverting the player's expectations. The game never explictly lies to the player, but it frequently gives the player incomplete information and allows the player to lie to themself.

[WARNING: The remainder of this summary includes very important story spoilers. I've rot13'd it to avoid anyone reading it by accident.]

Game summary: Deltarune

Although the name of "Deltarune" could be considered a spoiler, I'm going to assume it's known widely enough that I shouldn't bother trying to be mysterious about this.

Deltarune is the mysterious sequel to Undertale. It takes place in a universe different, but not quite separate from the one in which Undertale takes place. It was released on October 31st 2018 via a series of mysterious tweets from the Undertale Twitter account.

The original website on that day can be seen in the Internet Archive: <https://web.archive.org/web/20181031130251/https://www.deltarune.com/>

Once again, the game never explicitly lies to the player, but it does take every opportunity it can to make the player lie to themself. The player thinks they're taking a survey (which is technically true), but the result is discarded and the true game begins once the survey is completed.

Gameplay follows a similar format to Undertale, but combat is done in a party of one or two additional characters, and running exists as a movement mechanic. Also, instead of random battles, the game shows all encounters in the overworld as characters that chase the player.

Footnotes:

¹ no-hit and true pacifist are violated in cases where gameplay makes it impossible to do otherwise.

An exhaustive list:

- The fights with Asgore and Photoshop Flowey at the end of the neutral route of Undertale require dealing damage to continue. These are erased from the timeline once both are completed, so they are considered non-canon by the true pacifist route, which comes afterward. The no-hit rule still applies during this section of the game.
- There is no way to avoid Susie dealing damage to K.Round the first time it is encountered. However, it cannot be killed via this method as it has an unlimited supply of soy milk.
- [unsure if this is the case; will check] Taking damage in the Deltarune prison sequence is required to end the fight between Lancer and Susie. Lancer is guaranteed to take damage. If possible, I will avoid taking damage on Susie, although this is slower if it is even possible.
- Some cutscenes towards the end of Undertale show the player's health being reduced. These are unavoidable without the use of glitches. The player never has control of their character during these reduced-health states.

² This refers to developer-intended hidden methods of skipping gameplay. Any non-developer-intended skips are already covered by the "glitchless" category.

For example, some puzzles in Undertale can be bypassed via a nearby hidden switch, and Deltarune allows skipping the entire overworld section of the game on NG+ by going back to bed.

Non-examples include dialogue-based skips (such as giving a negative response to "do you want to watch a long unskippable cutscene") and hidden switches that are the intended solution to puzzles (that is, the puzzle cannot be completed in any way other than the hidden switch).
